## Tech Stack

- **React 18** + TypeScript
- **Vite** (build tool)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)
- **Lucide React** (icons)
- **Chrome Storage API** (data persistence)

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- `storage`: To save cluster configurations locally
- `<all_urls>`: To connect to any Elasticsearch cluster URL

## Notes

- Credentials are stored locally in Chrome storage
- All API calls are made directly from the browser (CORS handled by Chrome extension permissions)
- Icons are placeholders - replace with proper icons for production
